# python-instacart-analysis
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate data wrangling, data merging, deriving 
variables, and grouping and aggregating data within Python. Data visualizations within Python 
have also been created and a final report was created for Instacart stakeholders using Excel.

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart is looking to uncover

strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.
